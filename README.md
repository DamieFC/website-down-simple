# Website Down Simple
## About
This idea came while doing my web design hobby and I was doing changes, but I didn't want people to come and see, hey, say, this sentence is unfinished! Now, I can change folders for my web server, so all I had to do was make a new folder, make a new file, add the HTML code, and there ya go.
## CONTRIBUTING
You can contribute by adding code (I am working to add the dinosaur game from Google Chrome when you have no internet), branches, forks, whatever. Just make sure if you want something personal you download the code first, then add your changes, or do a fork.
## THANKS! :smiley:
